```java

    /**

    5.6 Binding Native Method Implementations
    
    绑定本地方法实现

    Binding is the process by which a function written in a language other than the
    Java programming language and implementing a native method is integrated into
    the Java Virtual Machine so that it can be executed. Although this process is
    traditionally referred to as linking, the term binding is used in the specification to
    avoid confusion with linking of classes or interfaces by the Java Virtual Machine.

    绑定是一种过程，通过该过程可以将用Java编程语言以外的其他语言编写并实现本地方法的功能集成到Java虚拟机中，以便可以执行该功能.
    尽管传统上将此过程称为链接，但在规范中使用术语绑定是为了避免与Java虚拟机与类或接口的链接混淆.
